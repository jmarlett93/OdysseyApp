<h2 class="blue">Welcome</h2>

<div class="">
    Welcome to the Odyssey App. After sacking Troy, the Greek heroes prepare to make the long journey home. They have not seen their cities, parents, wives,
    children, or homes for decades. The finest kings and princes of the Greek world have no idea what to expect at their homecoming. Wrathful gods, many of whom sided with the
    Trojans during the war, have their own personal scores of vengeance to settle.
